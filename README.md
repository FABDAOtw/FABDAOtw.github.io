# Green Sofa Dashboard

## Summary

We aim to build a Taiwan-specific Hypercerts Dashboard to track, analyze, and showcase the real-world impact of local Public Goods Funding (PGF) projects. This tool will address two key challenges — limited reviewer capacity and trustworthiness of impact evaluation — while generating verifiable, onchain data to support the scaling of PGF mechanisms across regions.

## Problem

The current PGF landscape faces a bottleneck: Gitcoin’s PGF ecosystem lacks localized, data-driven case studies, particularly in Asia. Reviewer scarcity and manual evaluation processes limit scalability and transparency. In Taiwan alone, we have already seen dozens of public goods projects, multiple Hypercerts issued, and hundreds of contributors, yet their impact remains fragmented and hard to verify.

## Opportunity

Taiwan serves as an ideal sandbox for PGF research and experimentation, combining grassroots civic tech (e.g. g0v.tw) with emerging Web3 infrastructure (e.g. FAB DAO, GreenSofa). Through collaboration with GreenSofa, which redistributes global Web3 public goods funding (via Gitcoin, Giveth, and Octant) to local Taiwan projects, this initiative has evolved into a sustained and recurring PGF model.

The proposed Hypercerts Dashboard will become the core verification and visibility layer for these recurring funding activities — bridging onchain impact proofs with offchain outcomes. It will also fill the current technical gap in the Hypercerts ecosystem, including data visualization, review interface, and IPFS-based impact document storage.
